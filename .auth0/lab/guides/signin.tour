The extension uses the [Auth0 Deploy CLI Tool](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool) to ensure your Auth0 tenant configurations are set up correctly and to ensure the correct values are pulled from your tenant to local environment variables.\n\n1. Click [**here**](command:auth0.auth.signIn) to sign into your Auth0 account with the Auth0 extension.\n     A browser window will open requesting that you confirm that the pairing code shown matches the one shown in the lower right-hand side of this window.\n\n\n1. Confirm that the values match, then click the **Confirm** button.\n\n     ![Confirm the values in VS Code](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/create-1.gif)   \n\n     ![Confirm the values in Auth0](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/create-0.gif)   \n\n1. The default tenant should already be selected (it starts with *dev-*) \n\n1. Scroll down and click **Accept**. You should see a success message. You can close this browser tab now!\n\n1.
